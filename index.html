<p>
  Washington Square Park in the early morning is different than it is later in the day. 
  <br>
  As the day progresses, this park becomes a destination for people, but right now, it's
  <br>
  just part of the morning commute. The majority of people here at 8AM are not sitting and
  <br>
  enjoying the morning, but instead walking through, sometimes without even looking up.
  <br>
  The most beautiful part about Washington Square Park at this time of day is how silent 
  <br>
  it is. The rest of the city seems so far away, and all you can hear are the quiet voices
  <br>
  and movements of other people, the occasional barking dog, and the wind.
